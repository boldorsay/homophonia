         <p>HOMOPHONIA is a magazine dedicated to the intersections of sound, language, and image – where words slip, echo, misalign, and recompose.           <br>
          Its name derives from the term *homophony*:
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="italic">
          the phenomenon where two or more words share the same sound but carry distinct meanings.
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          We embrace this not as a glitch, but as a method. A strategy of listening. HOMOPHONIA explores how sound unsettles meaning, how visual forms translate the sonic. 
          <br>
          <br>
           Each issue begins with a *homophonic pairing*. These pairings serve as gateways for poetic, political, and artistic exploration, guiding both the editorial rhythm and the interplay between visual and textual elements.

           Issue 1: Mourning/Morning
           <br>
           <br>
            mourning /ˈmɔːnɪŋ/ (n.) 
           <br>
           <br>
           the expression of deep sorrow for someone who has died
           <br>
           <br> 
           morning /ˈmɔːnɪŋ/ (n.) the period of time between midnight and noon
           <br>
           <br>
            Grief and beginning. Loss and return.
            <br>
            <br>
             Same sound, different time.
             <br>
             <br>
             We don't choose between them – we let them speak over each other.</p>

      <p>These parrot tulips <br>
        betoned how much <br>
        I will miss the touch <br>
        of our two lips. <br><br>
        
        The flowers you offered me <br>
        for our anniversary <br>
        fell <br>
        and I wish I could smell <br>
        you <br>
        the way that I used to. <br><br>
        
        The flowers were the only thing I could focus on. <br>
        Half of the scene welcomed a flare, as dawn <br>
        fought its way through the darkness of the night. <br>
        I knew I would have to put up the same fight. <br><br>
        
        It won't be the last, he won't be the last, <br>
        as I try to focus on the future rather than the past. <br>
        The night slowly swallows the last shine <br>
        reminding me you were no longer mine. <br>
        But I perceive sparks in the gloom. <br>
        I know I will too be able to bloom. <br><br>
        
        The bright colours of the flowers looking down <br>
        contrast with the emptiness filling the walls all around. <br>
        But next to it, the black vase's relief <br>
        reflects the glow surrounding it – Relief! <br><br>
        
        Hope I seize. <br>
        Scope I cease. <br><br>
        
        ••• <br><br>
        
        Flowers. Funny how one thing can symbolise <br>
        love and death at the same time. <br>
        Flowers… for the fallen ones, and the ones we've fallen for. <br>
        I mourned our love as my desire to keep you with me <br>
        felt like a fight against life's power of separating people. <br>
        This morning, it hit me again as I read this poem one last <br>
        time. <br>
        These lines that I wish were longer, <br>
        like I wish these years next to you were. <br>
        These rhymes reflecting how we used to echo each other <br>
        when I would tell you "I love you" and you would reply <br>
        "me too". These enjambments miming how we used to <br>
        intricate our bodies when we would make love. But also, <br>
        these stanzas parting, and this last couplet ending like we <br>
        did. <br>
        My love for poetry and art might be the only love I will <br>
        ever suffer from, at least they will never leave my side. <br>
        This might be a poem about heartbreak, but it might also <br>
        be a love letter to them as both remind us that some <br>
        canvases never leave their frame, and some words never <br>
        leave their page. Nevertheless, I knew I would have to let <br>
        you go – so I did. <br>
        Mourning. <br>
        Mourning. <br>
        Another morning without u.</p>
